# TDDbyE
## Code samples from Test-Driven Development by Example, in various languages

### This version of `README.md` is associated with the Python branch and implementation.

To run this code, type `python pytest.py` at the command-line.

In the first two commits (pages 92 and 93), the desired output is this:
```
None
1
```

From the end of chapter 18 onward (as far as through chapter 20, at least), the desired output is nothing.
If a test fails, Python will show you an assertion error.
